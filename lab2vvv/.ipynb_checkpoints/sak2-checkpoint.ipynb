    "First, we will load a data set of digits drawn from zip codes written on US mail. This data set was designed to help get good algorithms to sort mail by zip code automatically. It has been preprocessed a bit, with details given <a href=\"http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/datasets/zip.info.txt\">here</a>. Each feature vector consists of $16^2$ real values representing grayscale values of a 16 by 16 image of a digit. The training data has 7291 samples, while the validation data has 2007 samples. Note that this is not the same dataset built into scikit-learn -- it is much larger. "
